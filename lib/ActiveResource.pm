=head1 DESCRIPTION

ActiveResource is a set REST API that was defined in Ruby on Rails
project, and this the implementation in Perl that can talk to any
Rails server that supports it.

To use this api, you MUST name you you classes the same as model
names.  For example, redmine system provide REST api for therir
projects and issues, and they named them "projects" and "issues". To
talk to them with ActiveResource, we must defind two classes:

    package Project;
    use parent 'ActiveResource::Base';

    package Issue;
    use parent 'ActiveResource::Base';

It is planed to be make the model name configurable in the future
releases.
